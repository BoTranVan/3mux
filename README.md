Most of the features implemented by this already exist in `tmux`.

The difference is that `tmux2` comes with sane default with a few nice touches.

## Features
- [x] scrollback with your mouse or scroll wheel

- [ ] text search
- [ ] fancy text selection
- [ ] reading i3 configs
- [ ] reading tmux configs
- [ ] fullscreen mode allows for easy selection of text

## Decisions

### Text Selection
Originally, text selection was going to be done via vim-like highlighting followed by placing text alone on the screen.

This is confusing and interrupts one's workflow. Instead, users should make the selected pane fullscreen, then select from there. That's one shortcut and one drag instead of two drags and a keypress to signify that copying is complete.
